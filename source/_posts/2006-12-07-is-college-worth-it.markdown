<a href="http://www.aboutreef.org/is-college-worth-it.html">Is College Worth It?</a><br /><br />This article takes a look at the decision of investing in an education. It doesn't consider the social aspect of the college experience, but simply the return on the investment.<br /><br />
								  The analysis begins by assessing a college education purely as a
								  monetary investment. Undoubtedly, there are other benefits beyond money
								  to attend college, but it's such an enormous economic decision that it
								  seems foolish to not fully understand the financial ramifications and
								  use that as a primary factor in the decision process.<br /><br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">powered by <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">performancing firefox</a></p>
