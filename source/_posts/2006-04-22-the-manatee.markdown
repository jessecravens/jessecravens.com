In a baby blue trailer in East Texas pines,
Can't remember the bad, can't forget the good times,
Aint' no hot water, aint' no TV,
Were lovinâ€™ life in the Manatee.

Breakfast at noon and lunch at three,
And the cheapest damn beer we ever did drink,
Common folk they just canâ€™t see,
How were lovinâ€™ life in the Manatee.

And the more we sing, and the more we play,
The more we realize it aint' about the race,
One life to live in this here place,
We might as well have a smilinâ€™ face.

A case of Lone Star and some rice and beans,
Bellys a bulginâ€™, we got enough eat.
Aint no hot water, aint no TV,
Were lovinâ€™ life in the Manatee.

The chickens are smellin, and the neighbors are a yellinâ€™,
Where the dogs are?  There aint no tellinâ€™,
Common folk, they just canâ€™t see
How were lovinâ€™ life in the Manatee.

And the more we sing, and the more we play,
The more we realize it aint about the race.
One life to live in this here place,
We might as well have a smilinâ€™ face.

Aint no hot water, aint no TV,
Were lovinâ€™ life in the Manatee.

Common folk they just cant see,
How weâ€™re lovinâ€™ life in the Manatee.
