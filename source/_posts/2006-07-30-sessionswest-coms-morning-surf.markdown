Another new design for <a href="http://sessionswest.com">SessionsWest.com</a>. I was digging for inspiration for this site, when Jeff called me from San Deigo last week right before he was about to go surfing. </a>The color scheme is known as 'Morning surf,' and I built a custom flash player inspired by the album cover from the Fever Sessions. This new buildout has been my most complex drupal site to date. I embedded a photo gallery, and the mp3 player I mentioned earlier. I used drupal's front page module to give the home page a real clean, simple entry to the site. All in all it doesn't get much more simple, but I think thats what I like about it , and it reflects Jeff's style to the tee.
