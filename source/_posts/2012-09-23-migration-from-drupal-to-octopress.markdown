## Why?

For the last 6 years, I have hosted my personal blog using Drupal at bluehost.com, and I finally have made the decision to migrate.

With other content, I have been using Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, and Node.js for prototypes, demos, web-based presentations, and production apps. I have deployed to Heroku for the past couple of years. 

The productivity gains and integration with github and social media, have brought me to the point that I'd prefer for my workflow for blogging, updating to my microformats resume and protfolios to be similar to how I create and manage my other content. 

So here, it is. Once I have written a proper migration script, and taken care of all the custom urls, I'll post my solution here.
