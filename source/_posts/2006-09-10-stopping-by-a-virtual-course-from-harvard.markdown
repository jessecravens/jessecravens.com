<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/cyberone/2006/07/21/hello-world/">CyberOne: Law in the Court of Public Opinion Â» Welcome to Law in the Court of Public Opinion!</a><br /><br /><p>Enrollment to the Harvard Extension School is open to the public. Extension students will experience portions of the class through a virtual world, known as Second Life. Videos, discussions, lectures, and office hours will all take place on Berkman Island. Students from anywhere in the world will be able to interact with one another, in real time.</p><br /><br />This should be interesting I may stop by, if I cant fit it in. Should be a monumental event. <br />
