We had a great turnout for the 'Battle of the HTML5 Hackers' presentation at SXSWi on Tuesday.

Using our best CDD (Conference Driven Devlopment) techniques, we walked the audience through the creation of [Nerdclustr](http://nerdclustr.jit.su): an HTML5 mobile Application that helps nerds find other like-minded nerds at conferences events. 

Using realtime and mapping technolgies, the app visualizes nerd behavior in map pin clusters.

Here is a shot of the app in action (Ballroom G in the Austin Convention Center); it performed well during the presentation. Thanks to [Nodjitsu](https://www.nodejitsu.com/) for the quality node.js WebSocket service. After a 2-day hackathon to get the app launched, I ran through a number of deployment options, many of which I have used before for Rails applications. [Nodjitsu](https://www.nodejitsu.com/) won out in that it actually supported the WebSokcet protocol and made deployment super simple using the jitsu CLI.

Nerdclustr source code is available [here](https://github.com/html5hacks/nerd-clustr). 

During the book signing, the bookstore informed us there were only 3 copies left. I'm not keen to the selection process of books, but I was little surprised at the limited number of technical books. This is certainly a reflection of the SXSWi demographic, and we also tailored our content and presentation style to this audience. 

The slide deck is available here:
