If you haven't been keeping up with the latest in CSS. <a href="http://www.css3.info">Here is a site dedicated to doing it for you.</a> 

Also today I tried out a few new Firefox extensions. All of which I think I will keep activated:
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1368/">Colorful Tabs</a>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1327/">Grocery List Generator</a>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2587/">Bibirmer Toolbar</a>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2372/">GCalQuickTab</a>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1768/">TabSidebar</a>
