...lyrics were adapted from the poem When Wicked Winds Weather

When your mad about the system 
Apathy is your biggest mistake
When your mad about the system
You can turn that rage into change

Its time that we all conquered our fears

When the political minds are erasing
The truth in front of all of our eyes
In years to come we will be facing
The harsh realities without the lies and disguise

Its time that we all conquered our fears

Fortress built around a persona,
Eroded Freedoms, Intuitions thought twice,
Hesitated streams of consciousness,
Interrupted to begin, again and again

Its time that we all conquered our fears

Is it not ironic that weâ€˜ve squandered
Any notions of a matriarchy
When our Motherâ€™s milks are running low
Yes,  our Motherâ€™s milks are running low

Were making mincemeat of evil 
Spoon-feeding the ice cream through glowing TVâ€™s
A feasible feast when a Giant
Amongst a miniscule Pharisee.
