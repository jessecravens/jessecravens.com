So digg and reddit have both posted on the work of Stu Nichols and his pure CSS photo gallery. Check it out: <a href="http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menu/lightbox.html#Trees">here</a>. I'm anxious to try it out. I'd like to find a way to blend this image gallery with a liquid three column layout, but the gallery is fixed - so it may have to be implemented on an internal page. Although, it would be interesting to have this image gallery present on a home page - since before the hover it only takes up the room of a horizontal menu. I'll be exploring this idea further - stay tuned.
