<p>I stumbled upon the Big Dummy Longtail from Surly today while purchasing a 09' Trek 4500 24" frame at the <a href="http://bicyclesportshop.com/">Bicycle Sport Shop in Austin.</a>. Btw, for riders 6'6" and above, afters years of research, this is the only non custom frame I could find for entry/intermediate tall riders. I'll be doing some customizing as needed, but at least I have an inexpensive starting point. So...I love the size and fit of the Trek, but I can't get over the sweetness of the Big Dummy Longtail. Someday, I'll use the <a href="http://www.xtracycle.com/home/hitchless-trailer/technical-specifications/">Xtracycle Free Radical conversion kit</a> to convert my cruiser.</p>
