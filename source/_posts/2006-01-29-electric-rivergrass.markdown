The sounds of the Original TRB - I updated the playlist in the flashplayer above to include some of the old recordings from the original Tuscarawas River Band. Stay tuned for an entire tribute section with audio, imagery, and special surprises from the ol' days. <img id="image36" src="http://jessecravens.com/images/2006/01/bryce.jpg" alt="bryce.jpg" height="198" width="300" style="float:left;margin:10px;border:1px solid black" /> After looking through a box that was stored away, I came across old tour schedules, pictures, and cds. There was even a disc of photographs by Dave Bayo from Danny's Grill. I'm in the process of digitizing all of this material to include in the tribute section. In the meantime, enjoy the tunes on the flashplayer. There is even a high energy 'Big River' with Gus from the Juggling Suns on keys.
