<p>I know it is fairly well documented around the web that some of the old 'ROR up and running' tutorials are a bit difficult to digest with the new features in in Rails 2.0. So, I wanted to document my findings. And provide links to the resources that have helped me.</p>

<p>Here's a couple of resources to get started:</p>  

<a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/2007/12/12/rolling-with-rails-2-0-the-first-full-tutorial">akitaonrails.com</a>
<a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/stratdev/archives/2007/12/installing_rail.html">weblog.infoworld.com</a>

<p>Stay posted for more of my findings.</p>
