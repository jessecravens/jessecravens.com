I see this mistake often, and I often have to think about the difference between the two. So I thought I'd share. 

<strong>Than versus Then.</strong>

<strong>Than</strong> is a conjunction or preposition used in unequal comparisons:
(The taco was tastier than the burrito.)

<strong>Then</strong> is (usually) an adverb indicating time or consequence: 
(I bit into the taco. It was then I realized, the taco was tastier than the burrito.)
