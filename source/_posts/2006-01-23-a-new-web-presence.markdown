Hey...... maybe someday, someone will actually be interested in reading what I have to say. Actually I wil try to focus the content here more than I have in the past, but that would mean that I'd have to focus my interests. This is very difficult for me to do. So maybe I won't.

This theme is based on Zen Minimilist,which I have always thought had potential, it just didn't seem fully developed. With a little tweakin' to the CSS - I have become very pleased with it.
