I have been having quite a time installing Flash 9 with IE 7 and my earlier version of IE. 

This took me some time to figure out so I thought I'd share my solution. I tried editing the registry, I found this complete standalone installer that finally fixed the problem ! This is what you should do...

1. Download the un-installer and un-install Flash Player.

2. Then restart your computer.

3. Go to the Adobe website and install Flash Player again. The address is below.

4. Next, download the standalone installer.

After downloading it, install it.

5.Done ! Verify Flash player is working by going to this link.

Note: I have Microsoft Windows Home Edition SP2. I also have IE7.
