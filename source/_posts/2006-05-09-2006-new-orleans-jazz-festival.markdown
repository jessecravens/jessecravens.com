My Top Performances:
<a href="http://kellerwilliams.net/">Keller Williams</a> and <a href="http://www.jakeshimabukuro.com/">Jake Shimabukuro</a> (smokin' Ukele player) Late Night at the House of Blues.

<a href="http://www.amandashaw.com/index.htm">Amanda Shaw</a> on the Fais Do Do stage Saturday afternoon. Fais Do-Do became the word of the weekend: It means Cajun Dance Party - well, that makes sense.  

<a href="http://nathanwilliams.crazygator.com/">Nathan and the Chas Chas</a>: Home to New Orleans - had to be one of the most powerful songs of the weekend. Nathan had many in the crowd in tears. I love it when music does that to people.
