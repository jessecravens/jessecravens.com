I posted last week on our enchanted breakfast email campaign. Well, today we finished up part 2. <a href="http://trevordodd.com">Trevor</a> once again pulled off his flash magic, doubling up on Graham Nash, while <a href="http://markfigart.com">Mark</a> took on the role of Stephen Stills. I did my best David Crosby. Sorry Mr. Crosby, I tried.<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/enchanted2.jpg" alt="enchanted2.jpg" align="baseline" width="400" height="538" style="float:right;margin:10px;border:0px solid black"/> 
So...if you haven't heard, we are in a sense celebrating the Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young account. As expected... we are excited to take on the task of serving our new clients. 

I have been wanting to document my thoughts on my ideas of participation in interactive marketing projects.
