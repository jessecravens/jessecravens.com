<a href="http://digett.com/news/boerne-schools-test-the-waters-with-new-web-based-learning-environment">Boerne Schools Test the Waters with New Web-based Learning Environment | Digett</a><br /><br />My business computer programming class was fortunate to have Mark Figart of Digett as a guest speaker, yesterday. The students are preparing a podcast from the audio recording of the question and answer sessions. The students asked great questions and documented their responses as assignement entries in our <a href="http://boernevirtualschool.com">Boerne Virtual School</a> Moodle course. We are looking forward to having other speakers from the local Boerne business community. <br /><br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">powered by <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">performancing firefox</a></p>
