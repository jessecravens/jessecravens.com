In late April, I took my Ember.js talk to Louisville, Kentucky for the [CodePaLOUsa](http://http://www.codepalousa.com/) conference.

In the process I discovered [Doc Crow's Southern Smokehouse and Raw Bar's](http://doccrows.com/) BBQ and Bourbon menu. I highly recommend it for anyone in the area trying to find authentic, local fare.

During the day, I also listened to some great talks from [@sireb](https://twitter.com/sireb) and [@robtarr](https://twitter.com/robtarr).

My presentation focused on demoing the latest versions of [RockNRollCall demo application](https://github.com/emberjsbook), the source code for my upcoming book, [OReilly's Building Web Apps with Ember.js](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030782.do).
