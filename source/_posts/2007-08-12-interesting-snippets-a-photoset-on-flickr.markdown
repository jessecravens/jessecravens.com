<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lynetter/sets/72057594139269787/detail/">Interesting Snippets - a photoset on Flickr</a>  This is a fantastic set of images related to the state of the web, communications, and new media. Each image is accompanied by a thought provoking quote.  I thought this would be perfect for an anticipatory set for a new media presentation, or an introductory visual for a shared discussion on topics related to new media or web 2.0. Enjoy!
