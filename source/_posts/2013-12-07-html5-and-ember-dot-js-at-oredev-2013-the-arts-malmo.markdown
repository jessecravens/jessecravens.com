At the beginning of November, I was given an opportunity to give two talks in Malmö, Sweden at the Øredev conference. First of all, I have to say I was extremely impressed with the conference. Although the theme was the Arts, I found it to be a developer's conference with an artsy edge. The speakers I had a chance to see were developer's developers, one of my favorites being a talk on Meteor by Chris Mather (@eventedmind) of [eventedmind.com](http://eventedmind.com). I've maintained a peripheral view of Meteor, so it was good to get a beginner to intermediate overview of its capabilities. Given that I have been doing [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com/) / [Ember-data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) client work as of lately, I am particularly interested in exploring [minimongo](https://github.com/slacy/minimongo).

The city of [Malmö](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm%C3%B6) was also a pleasure to experience, and as you might imagine, the people of Sweden were very welcoming. One of the highlights for me was the speaker dinner at the [Malmö City Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jorchr-Malm%C3%B6_r%C3%A5dhus.jpg), originally constructed in the Middle Ages. On a side note, I finally had a chance to meet and have dinner with [Douglass Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/), a long time inspiration and virtual mentor, who was in town to give the keynote on [Managing Async with RQ](http://oredev.org/2013/wed-fri-conference/managing-asynchronicity-with-rq).

My first talk was a preview of my new book [O'Reilly's Building Web Apps with Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjsbook). I shared the stage with co-author and fellow frog, [Thomas Q. Brady](http://bashmodernquantity.com/about/). We took the audience through the creation of [RocknRollCall](https://github.com/emberjsbook/rocknrollcall), an intermediate level [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) application that fills in many of the blanks that most of the 'Getting Started' applications don't.

Some of the highlights of the book, and the talk, cover topics such as: a survey of Ember tooling, debugging with the [Ember Inspector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector/bmdblncegkenkacieihfhpjfppoconhi?hl=en), Ember boilerplates, app initializers, promises in Ember, the needs API, Ember components, 3rd Party JavaScript Integration ([jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [D3](http://d3js.org/)), Ember testing, SPA authentication, [Ember-data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) and other client-side persistence solutions, and remote data persistence with Ruby On Rails and Node.js.

My second talk was [HTML5 Hacks](http://html5hacks.com/) Evolved, where I continue to share more hacks from by first book [HTML5 Hacks](http://html5hacks.com), and [html5hacks.com](http://html5hacks.com/). This talk is culmination of HTML5 specifications that will have you rethinking browser-based applications. Some of the highlights of this talk included: Web Workers, WebSocket w/ GeoLocation, Device Orientation, and LeapJS, Web Components / Polymer / Ember Components (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, HTML Imports, Model Driven Views, and Local Storage.

In 2014, I'm retiring the HTML5 Hacks talks, to begin focusing solely on Single Page Application development in 2014. My hope is to kick out an early release of [Building Web Apps with Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjsbook) very soon, and finish the book in early 2014. After that I'll be in Louisville, KY at [Code PaLOUsa](http://www.codepalousa.com/) to continue the Ember.js roadtrip.
