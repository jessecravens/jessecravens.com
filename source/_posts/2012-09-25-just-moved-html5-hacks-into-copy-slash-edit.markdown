After a marathon of hackery starting in April, [Jeff Burtoft](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/5370) and I pushed out 90 hacks and 435 pages of [HTML5 Hacks](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026273.do) this week. We also had a few guest hackers that created some really great content as well. 

- Raymond Camden of Adobe
- Phil Legetter of Pusher.com
- Alexander Schulze of jWebsocket
- [John Dyer](http://j.hn/) of Dallas Theological Seminary
- Alex Sirota of FoxyTunes

Overall, it was a great experience. What I enjoyed the most was getting into a workflow groove, much like when you are building an API or contributing to a project. With each hack, it was necessary to ideate, plan, create the code, test it, and then put it into a understandable format. By the end, I was feeling pretty efficient at kicking out interesting hacks pretty quickly. 

I felt as though I improved over time, looking back is always interesting. I like to keep fine tuning and revising, but at some point you have to ship the product. I'm really proud of the work, it has been hard, but I learned a ton in the process. 

Most of my hacks I tried to make relevant to real world software development challenges, and mix in a number of HTML5 specifications. Hopefully, that turns out to benefit the reader ... I'm all ears on the feedback. So don't hesitate to drop us a line.
