<p>It was a great pleasure to share the stage with Brendan Eich (Mozilla), Paul Irish (Google), Lea Verou (W3C), Bill Scott (PayPal), Jesse Freeman (Microsoft), Dion Almaer (Walmart.com), and dozens more in the field.</p>

<p>We also had a great turn out for the book signing, thanks for all the support. And congrats to Doug Hall for winning a free ebook copy of our book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026273.do">HTML5 Hacks</a></p>

<p>I also added a few more new hacks, involoving Web Components (Shadow DOM, HTML Imports, Custom Elements) and Polymer.js. You can find that source code available here: <a href="https://github.com/html5hacks/fluent2013-html5hacks">github.com/html5hacks/fluent2013-html5hacks</a></p>
