  <div class="entry-content"><p>THE FOUR STRANDS ARE:  </p>


<p>Week 1  </p>


<p>Strand A: A Week In The Classroom  </p>


<p>These presentations will focus on the practical pedagogical uses of online social tools (Web 2.0) giving concrete examples of how teachers are using the tools in their classes. They will also show how teachers plan for using these tools in the delivery of their curricular objectives.  Strand B: Basic/Advanced Training (one of each per day)  Basic training is “how to” information on tool use in an educational setting, especially for newcomers.  Advanced training is for teachers who have already started using Web 2.0 tools in their classes and are looking for: </p>


<p>(a) advanced technology training (eg. how to write your own blog template or hack existing ones), </p>


<p>(b) new tools they can make use of in their classes, </p>


<p>(c) teaching ideas on how to mash tools together to create “something new,”</p>


<p> (d) a pedagogical understanding of how technologies such as Weblogs, wikis, podcasts, social bookmarking sites, RSS feeds and others can deepen learning and increase student achievement, or </p>


<p>(e) use of assessment tools to measure the effectiveness of Read/Write Web technologies in their personal practice and with their students.  </p>


<p>Week 2  </p>


<p>Strand A: Personal Professional Development  Tips, ideas and resources on how to orchestrate your own professional development online; the tools that support Professional Learning Environments (PLEs); how to create opportunities to bring these technologies to the larger school community; how to effectively incorporate the tools into your personal or professional practice; or how to create a supportive, reflective virtual professional community around school-based goals.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Strand B: Overcoming Obstacles  Tips, ideas and resources on how to deal with issues like: lack of access to tools/computers, filtering, parental/district concerns for online safety, and other IT concerns while trying to focus on best practice in the use of Web 2.0 tools.  </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://svconline.com/aveduc/podcasting_090606/">Podcasting: A Look Inside One School’s Implementation</a><br /><br />So Im beginning my second attempt to get podcasting to catch on at my school in my business computer programming class. This article is an interesting take on how podcasting can catch in higher education. In the K-12 environment, Im thinking student created content rather than a medium to archive a lecture. Keep track of our progress here: <a href="http://bcp.bmsn.org">bcp.bmsn.org</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My 9th grade Business Computer Programming class will be creating their own web page, as their first major project. Unlike most curriculums I have seen - the page will grow with them as they learn - and evolve into a fully functional html page w/ external css and javascript, and an embedded .swf that uses an xml playlist to play .mp3s.</p>


<p> I&#39;m beginning with basic html so that they can learn from the ground up the ins and outs of an IDE, basic html structure, elements, tags, tag attributes, commenting, viewing source code. </p>


<p>We will reamin simple with our code, but I feel it important to dig deep into the &#39;bigger picture&#39; aspects of writing html.  <br /> </p>


<p>We will also use firefox developer tools to examine our products. </p>


<p>  REMINDER TO CLASS<br /> <p>&#39;If you want to prepare yourself for the next generations of HTML, you should start using lowercase tags. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends lowercase tags in their HTML 4 recommendation, and XHTML (the next generation HTML) demands lowercase tags.&#39;</p> We will touch on CSS and javascript. I&#39;ll use javascript to introduce methods, functions, properties, and parameters.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another new design for <a href="http://sessionswest.com">SessionsWest.com</a>. I was digging for inspiration for this site, when Jeff called me from San Deigo last week right before he was about to go surfing. </a>The color scheme is known as &#8216;Morning surf,&#8217; and I built a custom flash player inspired by the album cover from the Fever Sessions. This new buildout has been my most complex drupal site to date. I embedded a photo gallery, and the mp3 player I mentioned earlier. I used drupal&#8217;s front page module to give the home page a real clean, simple entry to the site. All in all it doesn&#8217;t get much more simple, but I think thats what I like about it , and it reflects Jeff&#8217;s style to the tee.</p>
