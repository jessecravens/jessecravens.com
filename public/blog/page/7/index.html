  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another new design for <a href="http://sessionswest.com">SessionsWest.com</a>. I was digging for inspiration for this site, when Jeff called me from San Deigo last week right before he was about to go surfing. </a>The color scheme is known as &#8216;Morning surf,&#8217; and I built a custom flash player inspired by the album cover from the Fever Sessions. This new buildout has been my most complex drupal site to date. I embedded a photo gallery, and the mp3 player I mentioned earlier. I used drupal&#8217;s front page module to give the home page a real clean, simple entry to the site. All in all it doesn&#8217;t get much more simple, but I think thats what I like about it , and it reflects Jeff&#8217;s style to the tee.</p>

Boy, Rodney can sing and play. It was a real pleasure.</p>

<p>I also had a pleasure to meet Lynn Myers: Guitar, Fiddle, Vocalist &amp; Band Director of the <a href="http://www.1000hillscc.com/band.html">Thousand Hills Cowboy Church Band</a>.
I love that ol&#8217; Country Gospel music and I am looking forward to checking him and the band out soon.</p>

I like Harley&#8217;s songwriting and he has a great singing voice.<a href="http://harleydean.com"><img src="/images/2006/02/home_image.jpg" alt="home_image.jpg" style="margin: 10px; float: right; border: 0px" align="baseline" width="220" height="120" /></a></p>

<p>In the meantime, the Digett team will be enjoying the tunes of client, Joel Rafeal (<a href="http://www.joelrafael.com/">http://www.joelrafael.com/</a>) this Friday at the <a href="http://www.kerrvillefolkfestival.com/">Kerrville Folk Festival</a>.</p>

<p>Next week, I&#8217;ll be at the <a href="http://www.kerrville-music.com/rootsbluesclinic.htm">Roots/Blues Workshop</a> in Kerrville Tues - Thur. I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting <a href="http://www.suefoley.com/">Sue Foley,</a> <a href="http://www.thadbeckman.com/">Thad Beckman</a>, <a href="http://www.stevejames.com/">Steve James</a> and the other instructors, and learning some new licks and techniques.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.northernlightsband.com/">The Northern Lights</a> will also be down from New England for the festival. <a href="http://www.northernlightsband.com/"><img src="/images/2006/02/NLband.jpg" alt="NLband.jpg" align="baseline" style="margin: 10px; float: right; border: 0px" width="200" height="143" /></a>I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting up with them. In 2003, I had a chance to share the stage with these great bluegrass players and the late <a href="http://www.vassarclements.com/">Vassar Clements</a> at the <a href="http://elkhenge.com/">Elkhenge Music Festival</a> in WV. If you are into authentic bluegrass, don&#8217;t miss their show.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This month&#8217;s issue of Wired is jammed pack with information pertaining to the next Green Revolution, and &#8216;tech meets nature&#8217; topics such as: sustainable business, our looming environmental crisis, eco-friendly products, eco-chic lifestyles, and a feature article on the resurrection of Al Gore.<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.05/green.html"><img src="/images/2006/02/cover14_05.jpg" alt="cover14_05.jpg" align="baseline" width="136" height="185" style="margin: 10px; float: left; border: 0px" /> </a>To me, all of this talk is old hat. To be perfectly frank, I was beginning to feel as though the neo-eco mindset would never catch on. All of this discussion in a magazine as cool as Wired sheds new hope on the Green movement.</p>

<p>I once took an Environmental History course as an undergrad that turned out to be one of the most inspirational classes I have ever taken. The class turned me on to authors such as Edward Abbey, Carolyn Merchant, Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, Teddy Roosevelt, etc. The semester experience and discussion of relevant topics fueled me to adopt a &#8216;Voluntary Simplicity&#8217; mentality and lifestyle that I have held on to ever since. For me, it clicked&#8230; and the point is&#8230;I just thought it was cool, so I adopted it as part of my identity.</p>

<p>All of this talk of conservation and simplification is nothing new. We all know this. I have often pondered: &#8220;What would it take to make it stick in the mainstream?&#8221;</p>

<p>In the article, &#8216;Rise of the Neo Greens,&#8217; Daniel H. Pink quotes Ken Kurani on consumer motivation to purchase hybrid vehicles:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Lower resource consumption is part of an identity people are constructing. They want to be seen as someone  who&#8217;s concerned about the world around them. At the same time, they want others to see that they&#8217;ve done this, so that others might see themselves doing this.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>In other words, it is more about style, being hip, and being seen being hip. Like it or not, this is a very big part of the Neo-Eco mindset. I would also venture to guess that this was a very big part of the first Green Revolution. Yet, the first time around there was something missing: mass appeal.</p>

<p>I feel this may be the Green Movement&#8217;s only hope in creating a Tipping Point. For those of you familiar with Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s salesman-connector-maven triad, the first order of business must be: To be green must be hip to the masses.</p>

<p><strong>Caroline Schoeder</strong>
<em>Some people change when they see the light, others when they feel the heat.</em></p>

<p>Unfortunately, it will take something extremely powerful to encourage people to change before it is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><strong>So what does this have to do with a neo-Green Aesthetic?</strong></p>

<p>Before something is hip, it has to appeal to people visually. My experience in education, culinary arts, business, and the music industry has taught me that people are influenced greatly by what they see more than any other sense. To be successul in any field, one needs to pay very close attention to visual details. In education, we say students have a visual learning style, and we arrange classrooms to ensure sucessful learning outcomes. In the culinary arts, your customers&#8217; first impression is the presentation of the food. Extremely important, yet so often overlooked. In any professional field, we talk of &#8216;Dressing for Success.&#8217; In the music industry, we pay close attention to lighting, dressing to fit the part, and providing a visual experience for the audience. Perhaps far more than we realize, people are controlled by what they see.</p>

<p>Yet, all that being said, people also yearn for authenticity.</p>

<p>This creates a very interesting environment for a movement, a tipping point, a revolution, whatever it is you&#8217;d like to call it.</p>

<p>Do you suppose the answer is a fusion of clean, minimilist visuals such as represented by <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.kottke.org/04/10/design-for-web-20">web 2.0 design</a>, <a href="http://www.toyota.com/">Toyota</a>, <a href="http://www.samsung.com/">Samsung</a>, even <a href="http://www.sony.com/index.php">Sony</a> with the green aesthetic trend setters such as <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Foods</a>, <a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/environment/watch.jsp">Sun microsytems&#8217; new eco-friendly line of servers</a>, and<a href="http://www.patagonia.com/about/main_about_us.shtml"> Patagonia</a>?</p>

<p>Are you seeing/experiencing the fusion/overlap of these aesthetics in your daily consumer/producer/professional decision making? Are you being influenced by this type of powerful imagery? I know I am, and I am consisitently seeing others being influenced as well.</p>

<p>So what killed the authentic, natural aesthetic the first time around? Ask a baby boomer&#8230;many will tell you that at one time it was hip to be green. So what happened?</p>

<p><strong>the awful 80&#8217;s aesthetic</strong> - it even ruined the authentic beauty of Neil Young. Have you ever watched &#8216;Live In Berlin&#8217; from 1986? Please don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s horribly painful to see Neil in parachute pants and a wireless headset.</p>

<p><strong>The dirty hippy aesthetic</strong>: As fun as it is to be free and uninhibited, no one wants to hang with the guy who reaks of body oder, and is dressed in a burlap sack&#8230;And who is going to take him seriously? Take a look at home-grown websites: Let&#8217;s compare: <a href="http://www.sunorganic.com/">Sun Organic</a> to <a href="http://www.wildoats.com/u/home/">Wild Oats.</a> One must not negelct the power of visual imagery when creating materials that promote the authenticity of your business/yourself etc. In this day and age, it is a recipe to not be taken seriously.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sensing that this neo-Green aesthetic is a much more powerful one; One that has much more potential to appeal to the masses. It is going to be interesting to continue watching it evolve.</p>

<p>By the way, did you know <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/mar2006/nf20060329_6971.htm">Walmart sells organic food</a>? They have been for quite sometime. I am now of course being the facetious devil&#8217;s advocate. There will always be those that take something remarkable and taint it, but to me the fact that the Global Corporation is selling organic food is a significant indicator of a change in consumer behavior.</p>

<p>How can you, your business, and your business community benefit from supporting this movement? It is something to think about.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I often demo games to determine if they could be used to teach the learning objectives set by the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills. While there are many games that theoretically could fit this &#8216;standards&#8217; mold, there are also many other challenges to implementing video games in the classroom effectively. (possibly a future blog post) <img src="/images/2006/02/spore.jpg" alt="spore.jpg" align="baseline" width="250" height="189" style="float: left; margin: 10px"/> I have tried games such as <a href="http://www.2kgames.com/civ4/home.htm">Civilization</a>, <a href="http://www.railroadtycoon3.com/">Railroad Tycoon</a>, <a href="http://simcity.ea.com/">Sim City</a>, and they all were a hit for a relatively short amount of time. Simply put, they just dont have the long lasting excitement of a game such as Halo 2.  It is very difficult to keep children engaged. Mark Prensky calls it &#8220;Engage or Enrage.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t agree more. I have been watching for the release of a new game: Spore. Will Wright&#8217;s new release, due out Spring of 2007, offers new hope for an exciting game that may serve some educational purposes.</p>

<p>from the <a href="http://www.tea.state.tx.us">TEA website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>(8)  Science concepts. The student knows that complex interactions occur between matter and energy. The student is expected to:
(A)  define matter and energy;
(B)  explain and illustrate the interactions between matter and energy in the water cycle and in the decay of biomass such as in a compost bin; and
(C)  describe energy flow in living systems including food chains and food webs. </blockquote>


<p>&#8230;from the <a href="http://www.xspore.com/">Spore website</a>.</p>

<blockquote><strong>What is Spore?</strong>

Spore is Will Wright&#8217;s (Sim City, The Sims) new masterpiece. Spore starts a player out as a single-cell organism swimming around in a primordial soup. As Will Wright explains it, this stage of the game is essentially like Pac-Man, and you basically devour microbes smaller than you while avoiding those that are larger. You can upgrade your cell by adding cilia, flagella, and other defense mechanisms in order to gain any advantage possible for a single cell. From there you&#8217;ll move on to the â€œwater worldâ€ phase of evolution. Your single-cell organism becomes a multi-cell organism. At this point, the gameplay switches from 2d to 3d but is still essentially the same: devouring the less fortunate and avoiding the bullies.

As time passes, you will be able to lay an egg and evolve further; rid yourself of fins and acquire legs. Once on land (should you choose to emerge from the sea), you&#8217;ll find yourself a part of a rich world inhabited by other player-created creatures. Unlike traditional massively-multiplayer on-line games, you won&#8217;t be squaring off against other players in real time competition. Instead, when a player creates a new creature it is saved to a master on-line server. Your world will be populated by creatures that will help bring balance to your ecosystem. In this way, you will experience the off-the-wall creations of other players without having to worry about being bullied.

As Wright demonstrated at E3, you&#8217;ll be able to teach your creature new behaviors by combining preexisting ones. A creature that knows how to eat can pick up food in it&#8217;s mouth and drag it to another location, for example. The possibilities presented to the player in terms of creation are truly remarkable. To continue evolving, you must find a mate by emitting a mating call. What follows is romantic R&B music highlighting sweet love making.

You creatures will begin to band together once their brain has evolved far enough. At this stage of the game, the player must manage a tribe of the creature they created. Players can upgrade huts and add items to camps such as a campfire. Still, this is just the beginning of Spore. Before long, your mere tribe will be a full-fledge thriving city. With these upgrades in technology, players may customize their creatures further by adding additional upgrades. The cities themselves can be tweaked in almost any way imaginable. Players at this level of the game can build military machines and attack other cities if they should choose to.

Finally, the player&#8217;s creature creation will reach a point in technology where they can create a UFO. With the UFO, the player can cruise around their planet â€œabducting contentâ€ such as other creatures or plant life. The UFO can also zoom out into outer space. Initial impressions of the game indicate that this is where the real fun begins. With the UFO, players can literally visit millions of other planets full of other player&#8217;s creations. From the sounds of it, Spore is going to be a monumental game that empowers the average gamer with one heck of a creative tool.</blockquote>
